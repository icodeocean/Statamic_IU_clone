Society and companies are currently facing huge changes. The reason for this is the rapid advance of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Many decisions in our day-to-day lives are already supported or automatically made by AI. “Artificial Intelligence” is a term that covers two distinct areas: one is general AI, which behaves similarly to a human, and the other is narrow AI, which actually outperforms humans in specific tasks. While artificial general intelligence has yet to be developed, artificial narrow intelligence has already achieved a number of remarkable successes, e.g. in medicine and merchandise management.

The online Master in Artificial Intelligence is broad in scope and will deepen your knowledge of machine learning. The 60-ECTS variant of the study programme gives you the opportunity to acquire specific knowledge in the fields of computer-based language and image processing, smart manufacturing in Industry 4.0, or autonomous vehicles. In addition, the 120-ECTS variant offers further opportunities for specialisation.

In order to best prepare you for the international job market, all of our study programmes are offered **100% in English**. What are you waiting for?

Have you already completed a training course, studied at a university or gained work experience? At IU International University of Applied Sciences you have the **opportunity to get your previous achievements recognised,** completely free of charge. By doing so, you can save valuable time and reduce tuition fees.
